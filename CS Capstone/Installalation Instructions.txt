Model Pipeline Installation instructions:
Note: All scripts currently use localized directory paths, so moving the scripts to subfolders
could throw off their searches for specific directories or files. Each directory check would
 have to be changed to use absolute paths before the scripts can be moved.

The pipeline requires Python 3 with its default packages to run,
and uses json file structures for inter-process communication.

To install the model pipeline, simply download the scripts into a folder of the userâ€™s choice
and run the PipelineController.py to perform a first time setup.
The ModelPipelineSetup.py script will automatically be called
and set up the necessary files to run the program.
Alternatively, the ModelPipelineSetup.py can be run individually from the command line.

Model files that would be processed should be placed in the Pre-processed directory,
and the recipe file associated with the batch should be placed in the Recipe folder.
The program is set up to only run if there is a recipe file for the batch,
so bear in mind that at least one recipe file should be present before running a batch
or the program will request to abort the current queue.

The file structure is set specifically, so renaming any files, scripts,
or directories will result in the program losing functionality of those renamed objects.
The only files that cannot be automatically detected and recreated are the scripts themselves,
so deleting the DTPipeline directory is safe.
